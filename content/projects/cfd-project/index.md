**Overview:**  
Computational Fluid Dynamics is a fundamental topic in engineering, allowing us to simulate real-world scenarios computationally with the help of numerical methods. This project implements a supersonic flow over a diamond-shaped airfoil surface using a 2D Euler solver with finite volume formulation.  

The solver was developed in two stages:
- A **first-order AUSM+up** scheme  
- A **higher-order TVD MUSCL formulation**  

The solver successfully captures **oblique shock waves** generated at the airfoilâ€™s leading edge and compares results (wave angle, Mach number, pressure and temperature ratios) with analytical solutions.  

### Results
- Solver captured **leading-edge oblique shocks** accurately.  
- Verified **wave angles and pressure ratios** against analytical data.  
- Demonstrated improvement moving from **first-order AUSM+up** to **MUSCL** scheme.
